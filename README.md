# GrayThumb

## Curb your YouTube addiction.

GrayThumb applies a grayscale filter to YouTube video Thumbnails.

## Why?

Color activates the same pathways in your brain that addiction does. It's used by UI designers and content creators to grab your attention and keep you stuck in the screen.

GrayThumb helps you neutralize that psychological trick.
